**App development** is the process of designing, building, and maintaining software applications for mobile devices, desktops, or other platforms. It involves several key stages:  

1. **Planning**: Identifying the app's purpose, target audience, and features.  
2. **Design**: Creating intuitive user interfaces (UI) and ensuring smooth user experiences (UX).  
3. **Development**: Writing code using programming languages like Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android), or frameworks like Flutter and React Native for cross-platform apps.  
4. **Testing**: Ensuring the app is bug-free, secure, and performs well.  
5. **Deployment**: Publishing the app on platforms like Google Play or Apple App Store.  

Post-launch updates and user feedback are vital to improving app performance and features.
