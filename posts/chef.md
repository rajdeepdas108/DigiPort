**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** and **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** are foundational technologies for building web pages:  

### **HTML**  
- Defines the **structure** and **content** of a webpage.  
- Uses elements like headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), and images (`<img>`).  
- Acts as the skeleton of the webpage.  

### **CSS**  
- Styles and formats the HTML content to enhance visual appeal.  
- Controls layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness using rules and selectors.  
- Enables flexible designs through features like **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **media queries** for responsive designs.  

Together, HTML and CSS allow developers to create structured, visually appealing, and responsive web pages.
